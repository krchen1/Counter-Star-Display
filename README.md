# Counter-Star-Display
This LC-3 assembly language program will have the user input a number between zero (0) and forty-nine (49). The program will only accept a valid number. All other input is ignored. The program will then print star characters ‘*’ to the console to match the number entered. The program lets the user know when it is done counting. The program repeats until 'q' is inputted.
